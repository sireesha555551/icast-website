              <h3>Overview</h3>
              <p>Engineering and Manufacturing industries constantly combat daily production problems together with the complex and interlinked market factors that contribute to the need of a highly proactive and efficiently managed system to survive in the business. Be it Purchasing, material supply, production, quality or finance - all areas need to be managed effectively to ensure that the overall targets are achieved. And more important is that there is a constant need to reduce the risk in multiple areas. </p>  
              <p>With all their available data that cover operational and technical areas, Manufacturing organizations constantly strive to have a golden copy of their information on which they can base their decisions with certainty. It is not easy as it is not merely a data, but there is a position to every atom of data in their activities and a semantic interlinking for the same data in multiple departments. And Organizations do not need a reactive approach towards their management needs, rather a proactive approach.</p>   
              <p>iCAST provides them a solution to their problem.
