            <h3>Sales</h3>
            <p>
              Sales force works effective if their dynamic need of information is available timely and precisely - be it on market preferences, prescriber needs, product feature acceptability, customer needs, order availability , Sales expansion etc.,. With deeper insights on markets, prescriber preferences and buying patterns, the opportunities are understood better and utilized. Availability of right facts enables the sales force to reach their sales targets effectively. Along with the understanding of the micro segmentation of the markets and customers, preferences of the prescribers and the trends of the same from multiple perspectives, "selling " never becomes realistic. Availability of the full information to satisfy the prescribers, retailers & other involved parties is the key to sales. Without proper insights, sales targets themselves become either too ambitious or too low. Lot of times opportunities are lost by not just having a right perspective on the data already available. In highly competitive market scenarios, having a longer pipeline conversion time, greater customer churn and losing out on opportunities, even though seemingly not problematic , many a times lead to greater losses. And green market pastures are not readily available, it has to be retained and nurtured with proper sales operations and order fulfillment.
